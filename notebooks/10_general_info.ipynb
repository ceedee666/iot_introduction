To acchive this objective a\n"," ESP8266-based microcontroller is used. This micorcontroller is connected to a temperature and humidity sensor. Using\n"," [MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) data form this sensor is transmitted to the\n"," [AWS IoT Services](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/). Finally, the data is analysed using\n"," [AWS IoT Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/).\n","\n"," ## Ressources\n"," Below is a list of tools and documents used during the course of this lecture.\n"," - MicroPython\n","     - Quick start documentation for ESP8266-based microcontrollers: (http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/quickref.html)\n","     - Installung the MicroPython firmware: (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/flash-upload-micropython-firmware-esp32-esp8266/)\n","     - Curated list of MicroPython libraries: (http://awesome-micropython.com/)\n"," - IDE\n","     - PyCharm IDE: (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n","     - MicroPython Plugin f√ºr PyCharm: (https://github.com/vlasovskikh/intellij-micropython#installation)\n","\n"," ## Passwords and Password Managers\n"," If you put devices or service on the internet it is important to consider security. Here is just one\n"," example of what can happen if you are not careful: (https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/8rj9ep/my_aws_account_was_hacked/)!\n"," It is very important that:\n"," - You need to make sure that you **never** publicly expose login information or certificated related to your AWS account.\n"," - You allways use strong passwords.
