    "The solution architechture consist of the following components:\n",
    "- Sensor data is read usind the the ESP8266 micro controller\n",
    "- Using the MQTT protocol this data is send to the [AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/)\n",
    "- The AWS IoT Core forwards the recieved data to [AWS IoT Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/). \n",
    "- AWS IoT Analytics stores the recieved data in a database for later analysis. \n",
    "- The analysis of the data can be performed using different tools e.g. [AWS Quicksight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) or a Jupyter Notebook "

    "## The MQTT Protocol \n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) defines the MQTT protocol as a\n",
    "> lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. ... \n",
    "> It is designed for connections with remote locations where a \"small code footprint\" is required or the network \n",
    "> bandwidth is limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT defines two types of entities: a MQTT message broker and a number of MQTT clients. An MQTT broker is a server that receives all messages from the clients. It is responsible for routing the messages to the appropriate clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the MQTT protocol data is organised in topics. A client publishes data to a topic. The message broker then distributes the information to all clients that have subscribed to that topic. Consequently, the clients publishing the data does not need any \n",
